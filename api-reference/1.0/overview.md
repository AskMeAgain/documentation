# Node APIs

**IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes that have read/write access to the Tangle. You can connect to these nodes to attach your transactions to the Tangle and find transactions on it.**

If you don't already have a node to connect to, we recommend [running your own](root://node-software/1.0/overview.md).

Running your own node has many benefits, of which the most important is that you don't need to trust a potentially malicious third-party node. If you were to connect to a malicious node, it could give you incorrect information about balances and transactions, leading to stolen IOTA tokens.
