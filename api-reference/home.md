# IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes that have read/write access to the Tangle. You can connect to these nodes to send transactions to them and get transactions from them.

[Introduction/Overview](/1.0/overview.md)
## See an overview of the available node APIs

[Node APIs/IRI](/1.0/iri-api-reference.md)
## Use the IRI API to attach transactions to the Tangle, find the balance of addresses, and find transactions.

[Node APIs/Chronicle](/1.0/chronicle-api-reference.md)
## Use the Chronicle API to find historical transactions.

[Node APIs/GoShimmer](/1.0/goshimmer-api-reference.md)
## Use the GoShimmer API to interact with the prototype IOTA network that's being developed without a Coordinator.
