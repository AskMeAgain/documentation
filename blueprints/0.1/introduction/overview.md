# Application blueprints

**Application blueprints explain how you can use IOTA to solve real-world problems and to support well-defined business needs.**

Blueprints are designed to do the following:

* Describe a problem and a solution
* Present an architecture that shows how to solve the problem by integrating IOTA into your existing systems
* Explain how you can test, edit, and deploy the blueprint

![Data Marketplace](../images/data-marketplace.png)
## [Data Marketplace](../data-marketplace/overview.md)
Data silos make it difficult to buy and sell data among different data points. To overcome this challenge, the Data Marketplace uses IOTA MAM channels to open up the data silos and allow users to make micropayments of IOTA tokens to the data owners in exchange for data.

![Track and trace](../images/intro_track_trace.png)
## [Track and trace](../track-and-trace/overview.md)
Due to a lack of due diligence and a lack of a vendor-neutral data source, returnable assets that are used within distribution networks are seldom returned to their original owners. This blueprint describes how a track and trace system for recovery of returnable assets has been implemented by the IBCS Group, using the IOTA Tangle and other IOTA technologies.

![Peer-to-peer energy grid](../images/p2p_use_case.png)
## [Peer-to-peer energy grid](../data-marketplace/overview.md)
Although the supply of energy is often automated, the payment system is expensive to integrate and often requires manual intervention. By creating a peer-to-peer energy grid with IOTA, you can automate the transfer of power and the payment for that power. This automation makes your infrastructure more dynamic and easier to update.
