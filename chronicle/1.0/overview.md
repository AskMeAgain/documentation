# Chronicle

**Chronicle is a permanode solution that takes transactions from a node and stores them in a distributed database that's secure and scales well.**

By running Chronicle, you have the following benefits:

- Store the history of the Tangle
- Store transactions that come from one or more nodes
- Keep a record of all transactions for auditing purposes

## Limitations

At the moment, it's not possible to filter transactions and store only a subset of them. When you run Chronicle, you must store all transactions that your node receives.

## Roadmap

Chronicle will be ported to Rust to align with the future strategy of the IOTA technology stack.

See the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/permanode) for more information.
