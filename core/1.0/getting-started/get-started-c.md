# Get started with the C client library

**To help you get started with the C client library, this workflow topic walks you through the essentials from sending a zero-value transaction to transferring IOTA tokens and monitoring a node for live Tangle data.**

:::info:
The sample code for these tutorials is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/c-iota-workshop).
