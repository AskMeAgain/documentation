# Get started with the Python client library

**To help you get started with the Python client library, this workflow topic walks you through the essentials from sending a zero-value transaction to transferring IOTA tokens and monitoring a node for live Tangle data.**

:::info:
The sample code for these tutorials is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/iota-community/python-iota-workshop).

## What you will learn

If you complete this guide from beginning to end, you'll learn everything from generating addresses to listening for live transaction on the Tangle.
