# Core

**The core client library provides the essential methods for using the IOTA protocol to send and receive transactions.**

With the core client library, you can:

- Build transactions and package them into bundles before sending them to a node
- Connect to a node and send it transactions to attach to the Tangle
- Connect to a node and request data from the Tangle such as transactions, and the balances of addresses
