# Distributed ledger technology

**Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a database architecture that allows the owners of digital goods to transfer them to one another without an intermediary such as a bank or a social media site.**

When data is stored in proprietary databases, it's difficult to share that data with others without it becoming changed and lost in other databases.

In traditional networks such as the World Wide Web, you send your message to a centralized computer called a server. For example, to post a message on Facebook, you send that message to one of Facebook's servers, which validates that you own the Facebook account (you are logged in) then saves the message in its database to allow others to see it. If Facebook decided to delete your message from its database, no one would be able to see what you wrote.

Distributed ledger technology replaces centralized servers with a distributed, peer-to-peer network. This way, all messages are sent to all the peers (nodes) in the network, resulting in a single source of truth that all participants can trust.

## What is a distributed ledger?

A distributed ledger is the database that's stored by all nodes in a DLT network.

DLTs can have two types of ledger:

- **Permissionless (public) ledger:** A ledger that's distributed among nodes that can be verified by anyone without permission. The purpose of a permissionless ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical copies. Nodes maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus on its state. A permissionless ledger can be used as an immutable global record of transfers.

- **Permissioned (private) ledger:** A ledger that's distributed only among nodes that are preselected by a central authority such as a bank or a government.
