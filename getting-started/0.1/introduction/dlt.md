# What is distributed ledger technology?

**Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a database architecture that allows the owners of digital goods to transfer them to one another without a middleman such as banks or social media sites.**

In traditional networks such as the World Wide Web, you send your message to a centralized computer called a server.

For example, to post a message on Facebook, you send that message to one of Facebook's servers, which validates that you own the Facebook account (that you are logged in) then saves it in the database to allow others to see it. If Facebook decides to delete your message from its database, no one will be able to see what you wrote.

Distributed ledger technology replaces centralized servers with a distributed, peer-to-peer network. This way, all messages are sent to all the peers in the network (not just those owned by Facebook), resulting in new opportunities for innovation.

Because all the peers in the network receive all the messages, the peers can work together to run algorithms that validate messages. As a result, you no longer need to trust a single entity to store and validate your identity. 

Each transfer in a DLT is kept as a record in a distributed ledger.

## What is a distributed ledger?

A distributed ledger is a database that's stored in all nodes in a network.

DLT can have two types of ledger:
* **Permissionless ledger:** A ledger that's distributed among nodes that can be run by anyone without permission. The purpose of a permissionless ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical copies. Nodes maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about its state. A permissionless ledger can be used as an immutable global record of transfers. We qualify this type of ledger as **public**.
* **Permissioned ledger:** A ledger that's distributed only among nodes that are preselected by a central authority such as a bank or a government. We qualify this type of ledger as **private**.

## What problems does DLT solve?

When data is stored in proprietary databases, it's difficult to share that data with others without it becoming changed and lost in other databases.

DLT creates a single source of truth that all participants can trust. When data is added to a distributed ledger, anyone with an internet connection can access it by connecting to any node in the network.
