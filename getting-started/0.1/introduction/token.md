## What is the IOTA token?

At its most basic level, the IOTA token is a record of ownership that's held by the nodes in an IOTA network.

    ADDRESS....ENDOFADDRESS;1000

On the left of the semicolon is an address. These are unique to each client in the network. On the right of the semicolon is an amount of IOTA tokens that belong to that address, in this case 1,000 tokens.

## What makes the IOTA token valuable?

The IOTA token is valuable for the following reasons:

* **It's finite:** All nodes agree that a maximum of 2,779,530,283 277,761 tokens exist in the network. This maximum number is built into the network and can't ever be changed.
* **It's useful:** To transfer value in an IOTA network, you must use the IOTA token.
