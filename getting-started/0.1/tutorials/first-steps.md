# Get started

**IOTA is a lightweight protocol that can be used to build applications that transfer data or IOTA tokens.**

To use any IOTA network as a client, you need to [create a seed](../tutorials/create-a-seed.md). This seed allows you to use applications such as the Trinity wallet to send data or IOTA tokens.

## Developers

You can get started with IOTA by [sending your first data transaction with Node.js](../tutorials/send-a-zero-value-transaction-with-nodejs.md).

## Non-developers

If you want to see how IOTA works without having to write code, you can [send your first data transaction with the Trinity wallet](../tutorials/send-a-zero-value-transaction-with-the-trinity-wallet.md).
