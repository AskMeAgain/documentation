# Storing your seed

**You can store your seed in many ways, such as on paper or in a file. But, no storage option is 100% safe. This topic provides some advice for storing your seeds.**

### What to do

This list offers you some advice for storing your seed:

- Make sure that the physical location in which you store your seed is protected from fires, floods, theft, and other physical risks

- Keep a copy of your seed in a bank vault or safe deposit box

- Use a password manager (such as KeePass) or virtual vault that is protected by a passphrase and/or a key file

- Use an encrypted disk or NAS to store your seed or password database

### What not not do

This list offers you some ways to avoid losing your seed:

- Do not print your seed with a public printer

- Do not leave your seed on unprotected devices such as USB drives or external hard disks

- Do not store your seed on a public cloud service

- Do not share your seed with anyone
