# Transferring IOTA tokens

**You can transfer any amount of IOTA tokens on an IOTA network without any fees. This topic gives you a high-level overview of the steps involved in transferring IOTA tokens.**

## Creating a seed

To transfer IOTA tokens, clients need a secret password called a seed, which is used to generate their unique addresses and to create digital signatures.

Addresses are the accounts from which transactions are sent and received. Digital signatures prove ownership of an address and allow nodes to verify that ownership.

## Generating an address

All addresses have a balance of IOTA tokens that is kept on all nodes in an IOTA network. To start transferring IOTA tokens, you need an address.

## Getting IOTA tokens

IOTA tokens on the Mainnet have a monetary value. To send test transactions, you can use a [faucet](../references/glossary.md#faucet) to get test IOTA tokens.

## Sending a signed transaction

When you have test IOTA tokens, you can transfer them to other addresses by sending transactions to a node.
