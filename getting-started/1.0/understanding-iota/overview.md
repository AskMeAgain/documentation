## The Tangle

The Tangle is a public ledger that's shared across devices called nodes in an IOTA network. All data in the Tangle is stored in objects called transactions. When a transaction is attached to the Tangle, it cannot be changed: It's immutable. The integrity of the Tangle is guaranteed by cryptography.

## Nodes

Nodes are the core of an IOTA network, and are the only devices that can attach transactions to the Tangle and that keep an up-to-date record of the balances.

Interconnected nodes form an IOTA network by running the same node software.

## Clients

Clients are the users of an IOTA network who send transactions to nodes to be attached to the Tangle.
