# IOTA tokens

**The IOTA token is a unit of value (i, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi) that can be transferred over an IOTA network. This topic describes the history of the IOTA token, what makes it valuable, and how it's counted.**

## How the IOTA token was created

The IOTA token was launched on the Mainnet in June 2017. At this point, nodes in the network were hard-coded with a total supply of 2,779,530,283 277,761.

This large supply allows each of the billions of devices, which are expected to be a part of the Internet, to have its own wallet and transact with other devices.

## Value of the IOTA token

The following attributes give the IOTA token its value:

- **It's finite:** The maximum number of IOTA tokens is built into the network and can't ever be changed
- **It's useful:** To transfer value in an IOTA network, you must use the IOTA token

The value of the IOTA token is determined by supply and demand on any of the [available markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/#markets).
