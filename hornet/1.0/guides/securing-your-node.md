# Securing your node

**The security of the device that's running your node is important to stop attackers from gaining access to it. In this topic, you learn some best practices for securing your node.**

## Logging into your node through SSH

If you log into your node through SSH, you should use measures to protect it from unauthorized access.

Many guides have been written about this subject. For more information, see [10 Steps to Secure Open SSH](https://blog.devolutions.net/2017/4/10-steps-to-secure-open-ssh).

## Blocking unnecessary ports

Attackers can abuse any open ports on your node.

To secure your node against attacks on unused open ports, you should close all ports except those that are in use.

To do so, you can use a firewall. All operating systems include firewall options. By having a firewall in place you can completely block unused and unnecessary ports.
