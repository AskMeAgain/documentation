# Hornet

**Hornet is a lightweight alternative to the IRI node software. The main advantage of Hornet is that it compiles to native code and does not need a Java Virtual Machine. These features significantly increase performance, and make it easier to install and run on small devices.**

By running your own node you have the following benefits:

- You have direct access to an IOTA network instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node
- You help the IOTA network to become more distributed by validating the transactions in your IOTA network

## Limitations

Hornet receives transactions and records them in a ledger, it doesn't create or sign transactions. To create or sign transactions, you must use client software such as [Trinity](root://wallets/0.1/trinity/introduction/overview.md) or a [core client library](root://core/1.0/overview.md) and send the transactions to an IOTA node.

## Roadmap

Hornet is being built and maintained by a group of community developers alongside the IOTA Foundation.

Hornet will continue to be updated with the upcoming changes to the IOTA protocol in Chrysalis. See the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/chrysalis) for more information.
