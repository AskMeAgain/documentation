# Troubleshooting

**This topic contains known issues that you may find while using Hornet and some suggested steps to resolve them.**

## My node won't synchronize

It may take some time for your node to synchronize, so we recommend that you wait a while to see if it synchronizes by itself.

If your node still doesn't synchronize, make sure that your neighbors are synchronized.

In the **Neighbors** tab on the dashboard, you can see which neighbors are synchronized by the label next to their IP addresses.

If your neighbors aren't synchronized, the autopeering module will eventually disconnect from them and find new ones.

If you have fixed neighbors that aren't synchronized, you can wait until they are or find new ones to connect to. See [Managing fixed neighbors](../guides/managing-neighbors.md).
