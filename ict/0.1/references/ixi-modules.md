# IXI modules

**IXI modules extend the basic functionality of the Ict by streaming data from the gossip protocol into custom applications. Because the Ict is a permissionless network, anyone can build IXI modules and share them with others. This reference article contains links to the official IXI modules and some that have been built by the community.**

All official IXI modules and their configuration files are downloaded into the `/home/ict/modules` directory.
