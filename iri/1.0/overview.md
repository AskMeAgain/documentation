# IRI

**IRI (IOTA reference implementation) is open-source Java software for the IOTA protocol. This software currently runs on nodes in the [public IOTA networks](root://getting-started/1.0/networks/overview.md), where clients can transfer the IOTA token among each other.**

By running your own node you have the following benefits:

- You have direct access to an IOTA network instead of having to connect to and trust someone else's node
- You help the IOTA network to become more distributed by adding to the number of ledgers and validating the transactions in your neighbor's ledgers

## Limitations

IRI receives transactions and records them in a ledger, it doesn't create or sign transactions. To create or sign transactions, you must use client software such as [Trinity](root://wallets/0.1/trinity/introduction/overview.md) or a [core client library](root://core/1.0/overview.md) and send the transactions to a node.

## Roadmap

IRI is due to be replaced by another implementation called Bee later this year. Until then, IRI will continue to be developed.

See the [roadmap](https://roadmap.iota.org/mainnet-throughput-increase-iri-something) for more information.

## Source code

The source code for this project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri).

## Next steps

[Run IRI](tutorials/install-iri.md) to get started.
