# Choose an installation method

**In this topic, you choose how to install and run the IRI node software to turn your device into a node.**

:::info:
This software is now in maintenance mode. Only critical fixes will be made. We recommend using [Hornet](root://hornet/1.0/overview.md) if you are setting up your first node.
:::

## Prerequisites

To make sure that your device meets the minimum requirements for running a node, see [Getting started as a node](root://getting-started/1.0/nodes/overview.md).

## Choose a method

You have two options for running IRI:

- [Run IRI in a Docker container](../tutorials/install-iri-docker.md) (for Linux, macOS, and Windows)
