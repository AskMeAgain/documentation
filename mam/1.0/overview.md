# Masked Authenticated Messaging

**The Tangle allows you to attach zero-value transactions to it, but these transactions are not signed or checked by nodes to verify their authenticity. With MAM, all messages are signed by the owner of a seed. This way, those with access to a channel can validate the signature and decrypt the messages. Many use cases such as the [Data Marketplace](root://blueprints/0.1/data-marketplace/overview.md) use MAM to allow users to pay for access to channels and decrypt the messages.**

With MAM, you can:

- Create public, private, or restricted channels
- Send messages on channels
- Read messages from channels
