# Update IRI

**IRI is in a beta development stage, so it's likely to change, meaning that you'll need to update it.**

When a new version of [IRI is released on GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases), we recommend that you update your local IRI to the new version.

1. Stop IRI

2. Delete the `mainnetdb` directory, the `mainnet.log` file, and your current IRI `.jar` file

    :::warning:
    Do not delete your `spent-address-db` directory.
    :::

4. [Download the latest IRI and run it](../how-to-guides/install-iri.md#run-the-iri)
