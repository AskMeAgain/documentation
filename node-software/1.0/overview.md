# Node software

**IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes that run the same node software. This software gives nodes read/write access to the Tangle, allows them to validate transactions, and allows them to store transactions in their local ledgers.**

## [Hornet](root://hornet/1.1/overview.md)
Hornet is an implementation of IRI that is maintained by the IOTA community. This implementation will continue to be updated to include the protocol changes in Chrysalis.

## [IRI](root://iri/1.0/overview.md)
IRI is the original IOTA reference implementation for the IOTA Mainnet. This software is now in maintenance mode. Only critical fixes will be made. We recommend using Hornet if you are setting up your first node.

## [Chronicle](root://chronicle/1.0/overview.md)
Chronicle is an addition to the IRI or Hornet node software that allows you to store all transactions in a separate distributed database that's secure and scalable.

## [GoShimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/wiki)
GoShimmer implements a prototype of an IOTA network without the Coordinator. This network is still in development and is documented on a GitHub wiki.
