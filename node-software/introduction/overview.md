# Node software

**IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes, which are computers that run the same node software. This software gives nodes read/write access to the Tangle and allows them to validate transactions and store them in their ledgers. By running your own node, you have direct access to the Tangle, instead of relying on third-party nodes to receive your transactions.**

## [IRI](../iri/0.1/introduction/overview.md)
The IRI (IOTA reference implementation) is open-source Java software that currently runs on the IOTA Mainnet. This software defines the IOTA protocol, which allows clients to transfer the IOTA token among each other.

## [Ict](../ict/0.1/introduction/overview.md)
The Ict (IOTA controlled agent) is open-source Java software that defines an **experimental** version of the IOTA protocol that's designed to be more lightweight and modular than the IRI. This software is being rewritten in the Rust programming language. As a result, the Ict will eventually be replaced by the new Rust version, which will be called **Bee**.

## [Coordicide Alphanet](../ict/0.1/introduction/overview.md)
The Coordicide Alphanet is open-source Go software that implements a prototype of the Coordicide modules, which will lead to the removal of the Coordinator. This network is still in development. As a result, not all modules exist, but new ones will be added when they are ready.
