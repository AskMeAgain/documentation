# Back up your seed

**Trinity secures and stores your [seed](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/seeds.md) on your device. As a result, if you were to ever lose your mobile device or computer, your seed would be lost. To avoid losing your seed (and your IOTA tokens), you must back it up and keep the backup in a safe place. In this guide, you learn how to back up your seed.**

:::danger:
On 11 February 2020, the IOTA Foundation became aware of an attack on the Trinity wallet, during which some usersâ€™ seeds and Trinity passwords were compromised. Please check our advice for [protecting your Trinity account](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md).
:::

When you create an account (or [access your seed from the account management page](../how-to-guides/manage-your-account.md)) you can back up your seed, using one of the following options:

- SeedVault file (most secure)
- Paper copy
- Printed copy (least secure)

After backing up your seed, Trinity asks you to re-enter your seed to make sure that you backed up the correct one.

## Export your seed as a SeedVault file

Exporting your seed to a SeedVault file is the most secure option (apart from using a [hardware wallet](../concepts/hardware-wallet.md)).  

SeedVault is a password-encrypted file that uses the [kdbx file format](https://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html). This format is also used by the [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) password manager.

You can export and store your seed in SeedVault or in the KeePass password manager. 

## Write your seed on a piece of paper

Write your seed from left to right, top to bottom. **Check that your seed is written correctly.**

Make sure to write your seed's 3-letter [checksum](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/checksums.md) and keep it separate from your seed. This checksum is a safety mechanism that allows you to check whether you entered the correct seed. If you enter one wrong character, the checksum that's displayed in Trinity will be different.

## Print your seed

Although printing your seed is convenient, it can be unsafe. If you're unsure about security, then use another option to back up your seed.

## What to avoid

To keep your seed safe you should never do any of the following:

- Screenshot your seed.
- Print your seed on PDF file
- Print your seed from a public printer or one that's connected to WiFi

:::success:
Now you have a backup of your seed. If you ever forget your Trinity password, you can use your seed backup to log into Trinity.
