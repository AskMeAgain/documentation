# Change the advanced settings

**Advanced settings affect the functionality of Trinity. Change the advanced settings if you're familiar with how IOTA works.**

## Change the auto-promotion settings

To make sure that transactions are confirmed, Trinity can auto-promote (promote and reattach) them until they're confirmed.

To allow Trinity to auto-promote transactions, change this setting to **Enabled**.

To stop Trinity from auto-promoting transactions, change this setting to **Disabled**.

:::warning:
On mobile, Trinity does not auto-promote transactions if it's minimized (not open).
