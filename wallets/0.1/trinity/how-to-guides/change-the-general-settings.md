# Change the general settings

**The general settings allow you to change elements of the user interface, change your password, and change the nodes to which Trinity connects. In this guide, you learn how to change the general settings.**

## Change the display language

Trinity has been translated into different languages. Select one to change the language that's displayed.

## Change the node settings

Trinity interacts with the Tangle through a [quorum](../concepts/node-quorum.md) of default nodes. You can choose to add one of your own nodes to the quorum, connect to a quorum of custom nodes, or connect to a specific node to use for proof of work.

## Change the theme

Trinity has many themes to choose from. Each one changes how the application looks. 

## Change the currency converter

The current value of the token is displayed in the currency that is selected in this setting.

## Change the user mode

Trinity has two modes:

- **Standard mode:** Displays only the most relevant information for standard users
- **Advanced mode:** Displays technical information, such as error logs, for advanced users
