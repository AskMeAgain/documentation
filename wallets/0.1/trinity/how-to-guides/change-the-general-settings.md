Trinity has been translated into different languages. Select one to change the language that's displayed.

## Change the IOTA node settings

Trinity interacts with the Tangle through a [quorum](../concepts/node-quorum.md) of default nodes. You can choose to add one of your own nodes to the quorum, connect to a quorum of custom nodes, or connect to a specific node to use for proof of work.

## Change the theme

Trinity has many themes to choose from. Each one changes how the application looks.
