# Create an account

**Trinity accounts are password-protected to secure and store your seeds on your mobile device or computer. In this tutorial, you create a new account.**

:::danger:
On 11 February 2020, the IOTA Foundation became aware of an attack on the Trinity wallet, during which some usersâ€™ seeds and Trinity passwords were compromised. Please check our advice for [protecting your Trinity account](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md).
:::

--------------------
### Desktop

1. If you have already downloaded Trinity, click **Add new account** in the left-hand panel, otherwise [download Trinity](https://trinity.iota.org/) and open it

2. Select one of the options, depending on whether you have a seed (or a SeedVault file)
    
    If you have a [hardware wallet](../concepts/hardware-wallet.md), connect it and follow the on-screen instructions. You don't need to back up your seed if you use a hardware wallet.
