# Perform a snapshot transition

**During a global snapshot, nodes remove old transaction data from their ledgers to free memory. After a global snapshot, nodes have only the addresses with a balance of at least 1 i. If you don't see your correct balance after a global snapshot, you must perform a snapshot transition to allow Trinity to request the latest balance of your addresses.**

:::danger:
On 11 February 2020, the IOTA Foundation became aware of an attack on the Trinity wallet, during which some usersâ€™ seeds and Trinity passwords were compromised. Please check our advice for [protecting your Trinity account](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md).

:::info:
Trinity is stateful, which means that it stores a local copy of your transaction history on your device. As a result, you can still see your transaction history after a global snapshot.
