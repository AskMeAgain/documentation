# Read your balance

**Trinity regularly updates your balance by asking [nodes](root://getting-started/0.1/network/nodes.md) for the balance of all [addresses](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses.md) associated with your [seed](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/seeds.md). In this guide, you learn how to read your balance and troubleshoot Trinity if the displayed balance is incorrect.**

Your total balance is displayed at the top of the home page. You can also [view the balance of individual addresses](../how-to-guides/manage-your-account.md#view-the-addresses-of-an-account).

If Trinity can't connect to a node, it may display an incorrect balance.

To fix this problem, Trinity keeps a list of your generated addresses so that you can re-synchronize it the next time Trinity connects to a node.

If you think your balance is wrong (and a [global snapshot](../how-to-guides/perform-a-snapshot-transition.md) hasn't occurred), you can synchronize Trinity by going to **Settings** > **Account** > **Account management** > **Tools** > **Sync account**.
