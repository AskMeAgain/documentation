# Receive a transaction

**To receive a transaction, you need to generate a new [address](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses.md) and give it to the sender. In this guide, you generate a new address in Trinity and consider in which format to give it to the sender.**

1. Click **Receive**

2. Click **Generate address** to generate a new address

3. Either copy the address and give it to the sender, [create a QR code](../how-to-guides/create-a-qr-code.md), or [create a deep link](../how-to-guides/create-deep-link.md).

    :::danger:Important
    On Android devices, any application can read the content of keyboard presses and modify it. Be careful when pasting an address into another app and make sure that the address you have pasted is the same one that you copied.
