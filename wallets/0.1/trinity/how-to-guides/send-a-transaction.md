# Send a transaction

**Trinity's user interface allows you to send transactions at the click of a button.**

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need the following:

- A Trinity account
- An address to include in the transaction

:::info:
Addresses must include the 9-tryte [checksum](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/checksums.md). If you generated a new address in Trinity, that address will already include the checksum.
:::

1. Click **Send**

2. Enter a recipient's address

  :::danger:Important
  On Android devices, any application can read the content of keyboard presses and modify it. Be careful when pasting an address into Trinity and make sure that the address you have pasted is the same one that you copied.
  :::

3. Enter either a message, or an amount of IOTA tokens, or both

    :::info:
    The amount to send can be entered in [units of IOTA tokens](root://getting-started/0.1/clients/token.md#units-of-iota-tokens) or in the [currency of your choice](../how-to-guides/change-the-general-settings.md). Pay close attention to the amount that you're sending.
    :::

    :::info:
    If your account is linked to a hardware wallet, you can send either IOTA tokens or a message, but not both.

    If you minimize Trinity Mobile while sending a transaction, the sending process pauses until you reopen it.
    :::

When you either receive or send a transaction, it appears on the home page. Click a transaction from the list to view information about it.
