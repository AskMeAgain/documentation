# Trinity

**Trinity is a mobile and desktop application with a user interface that allows you to transfer data and IOTA tokens. With Trinity you can encrypt and store one or more seeds, where each one has its own account, transaction history, and settings.**

:::danger:
On 11 February 2020, the IOTA Foundation became aware of an attack on the Trinity wallet, during which some users’ seeds and Trinity passwords were compromised. Please check our advice for [protecting your Trinity account](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md).
:::

Trinity allows you to do the following:

- Create a password-protected account to store and access your seeds
- Read your balance and transaction history
- Send and receive transactions

## Security

To use Trinity, you must enter your seed. Therefore, to ensure the security of your IOTA tokens, Trinity has been audited by external parties.

If you find a vulnerability and you report it to us, you'll receive a monetary reward through our [bug bounty](https://bugcrowd.com/iota).

## Limitations

Trinity mobile does not support background processes. If you navigate to another app while an action (for example, logging in, sending transactions, and refreshing your balance) is ongoing, that action **won't** be completed.

If you use a Ledger Nano S with Trinity, you can't withdraw from more than two addresses in the same transaction.

For more information about this limitation, see this [community blog post](https://medium.com/@hbmy289/how-to-access-iota-funds-spread-over-too-many-inputs-on-ledger-nano-s-74708548fa6e).
