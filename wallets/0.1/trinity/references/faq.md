# Seed migration FAQ

**These are frequently asked questions about the recent Trinity attack and the seed migration tool.**

## What do I have to do to be safe?

Depending on when and how you used the Trinity wallet, you may need to take steps to [protect your Trinity account](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md) before the IOTA Foundation restarts the [Coordinator](root://getting-started/0.1/network/the-coordinator.md).

## Were my IOTA tokens stolen?

If you see any value transactions that you did not send in your Trinity history, your IOTA tokens may have been stolen.

See [this guide](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md) for steps on protecting your Trinity account before the IOTA Foundation restarts the [Coordinator](root://getting-started/0.1/network/the-coordinator.md).

If you don't see any value transactions in your Trinity history, but your balance is wrong, see the [Troubleshooting guide](../references/troubleshooting.md) for help or reach out on Discord.

## When will the Coordinator be restarted?


## The Coordinator was paused, does this mean that IOTA is centralized?

The [Coordinator](root://getting-started/0.1/network/the-coordinator.md) is a centralized “finality device”, which provides security during the network’s infancy.

The Coordinator will be removed when we have an implementation of all [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/) modules.

## How do I move my IOTA tokens?

While the [Coordinator](root://getting-started/0.1/network/the-coordinator.md) is paused, no one can transfer their IOTA tokens on the Mainnet.

We recommend reading [this guide](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md) if you want to transfer your IOTA tokens to a new seed before the Coordinator is restarted.

## Is it safe to share my addresses with others?

Yes. Addresses are public information and can be seen on https://thetangle.org/ for example.

:::warning:
Never share your seed or Ledger phrases with anyone.

## Can the Coordinator repay the stolen IOTA tokens?

No. The [Coordinator](root://getting-started/0.1/network/the-coordinator.md) cannot transfer IOTA tokens.

However, to protect certain users' IOTA tokens, the IOTA Foundation will temporarily transfer any that are deemed ‘at risk’ to another seed for safekeeping. This process will take place during a global snapshot, which will be validated by the IOTA community's nodes.

We recommend reading [this guide](../how-to-guides/protect-trinity-account.md) for more information.

## I use the IOTA light wallet, do I have to do anything? Will it still work after the Coordinator is restarted?

The attack affected only the Trinity wallet. If you have never used Trinity, you don't need to do anything. When the Coordinator is restarted, you can use the light wallet to transfer IOTA tokens again.

## Can I migrate directly to a Ledger hardware wallet?

## Trinity (1.4) says that it's "receiving" this missing amount, but it never really receives it.  I suspect it's a node synch error.  Migrating won't cause any complications, will it?  Or, do I need to somehow receive it (and have a correct balance) before migration?

## What can I do if I miss the seed migration period?

## What happens if the attacker uses the Seed Migration tool with a stolen seed? 

## Will my pending transactions be confirmed when the Coordinator is restarted?
